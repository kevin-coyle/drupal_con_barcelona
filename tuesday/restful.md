# Expose Drupal with RESTful
_Mateu Aguilo_

This is mainly D7.

Rest is more than just exporting entities.
 - CRUD, Auth, filtering

Benefits:
  - Data providers
  - Resource composition (Resource Nesting)
    - Entity that relates another entity. Stop multiple reqs.
  - URL query language.

API is a contract between backend team and front end team. You could remove Drupal and put something in its place.
